<p><span>Let it snow</span></p>
<div class="vers">
<p>Oh the weather outside is frightful But the fire is so delightful And
since we’ve no place to go Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!</p>
</div>
<div class="vers">
<p>It doesn’t show signs of stopping And I’ve bought some corn for
popping The lights are turned way down low Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let
It Snow!</p>
</div>
<div class="vers">
<p>When we finally kiss goodnight How I’ll hate going out in the storm!
But if you’ll really hold me tight All the way home I’ll be warm</p>
</div>
<div class="vers">
<p>The fire is slowly dying And, my dear, we’re still goodbying But as
long as you love me so Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow</p>
