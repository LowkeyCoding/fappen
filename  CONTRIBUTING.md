# Contributing
There are several ways to contribute to the official fappen github (not to be confused with the official new [Fappen](https://github.com/jonasKjellerup/fappen)), we recommend reading this file to familiarise yourself with our guidelines.

If you were linked here from an issue please read the first subsection on writing a good issue.

## Suggest a feature
The volunteers love creating new features so if you have an idea for something cool the system could do, please feel free to suggest it.

A good feature request gives context for the feature and tells a short focused story about how the feature will be used.

### Short example
> ### Implement multibuy
> Customers often want to buy several beers in a row and the current workflow of typing in your username and then using to mouse to click on the product can be sometimes frustrating.
> I suggest the ability to enter `<username> <product id 1> <number of products sought>` thus making it possible to buy several products in one purchase.

## Patches welcome!
If you want to contribute code you should fork the project.

## Coding standards

### Branches
